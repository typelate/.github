Typelate provides hypermedia power tools for Go developers building [hypermedia-driven applications (HDAs)](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/). It has been designed to make drafting, iterating, and refactoring hypermedia safe, fast, and effective.

## Development Updates

### DOM

[DOM](https://github.com/typelate/dom) implements a useful subset of the Document Object Model specification in Go. It is helpful for writing behavior-driven tests for HTML endpoints. The package works well with LLMs in your IDE because it is based on a well-known specification.

This has been used in personal and professional projects for years under [github.com/crhntr/dom](https://github.com/crhntr/dom).

### Muxt

[Muxt](https://github.com/typelate/muxt) is a code generator and static analysis toolkit for server-side rendered HTML.

## Example Projects

All example apps use Muxt, HTMX, and Postgres.

* [No -tools Example](https://github.com/typelate/no-tools-example) — Can be used as a template for new projects. It does not add muxt as a module dependency.
* [Sortable Example](https://github.com/typelate/sortable-example) — A more sophisticated example that includes migrations, database transactions, and more interactivity.
* [HTMX Template](https://github.com/typelate/htmx-template) — A simple app template repository.

## Roadmap

An integrated product adding value on top of Muxt and DOM is planned for early 2026.
